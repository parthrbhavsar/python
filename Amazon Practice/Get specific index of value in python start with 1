Determine the factors of a number and then return element of the list, sorted ascending.
The factors of 10 in ascending order are {1,2,5,10}. using 1-based indexing, if p=3, then 5 is returned.

Code 

def get_factors(num):
    return[i for i in range(1,num+1) if num % i == 0]

factors = get_factors(10)
p = 3
print(p, factors[p-1])


Out Put
3 5
